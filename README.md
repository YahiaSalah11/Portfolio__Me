# 🌐 My Portfolio

Hey there! 👋
This is my personal portfolio website — a place where I showcase my projects, skills, and everything I’m passionate about in web development.

I built it using **React** and **Vite**. The goal was to create something clean, responsive, and fast — just like the kind of apps I love to build.

Feel free to explore the projects, check out the animations, and see what I’ve been working on lately. 🚀
